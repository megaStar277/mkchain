# Contributing

If you would like to support this project, you have an interesting idea how to improve the operation of this tool or if you found some errors - do fork this add your fixes and add pull-request of your branch to the **testing branch**.

## Bash style

I would like you to stick to certain standards of writing in bash. I realize that it is not easy and time-consuming if you have certain habits. I do not expect 100% compliance and adherence to good practices, however, I would like you to try to use certain principles.

The following should help:

## Shellcheck

One of the requirements before approving your changes is to check them with the **shellcheck** utility. If the returned errors are not critical (eg. [SC2154](https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck/wiki/SC2154)) you can use the `shellcheck disable=SC2154` design.

## Comments

Comment on all your changes and describe what they are doing. A good idea will be if the code snippet you are changing is going to describe in this way:

```
# Author of changes: your_nickane <email_address>
# Description:
#   A short description of the changes.
# __EOF__
{...}
# __EOF__
```

## Pull requests

When creating pull request, please heed the following:

- Base your code on the latest master branch to avoid manual merges
- Code review may ensue in order to help shape your proposal
- Explain the problem and your proposed solution
